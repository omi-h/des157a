            <h2>frog cat plushie</h2>
            <p>This cat frog means a lot to me for several reasons! For one, it was a gift from my partner when we first started dating. On top of that, it's probably clear but I love all things frog. However, you might not have realized--I love cats too! This is like two of my favorite things combined, woah! Not only that, but this is also from a Japanese brand called Mofusand. I have some shark cats related to the brand also!</p>

            <h2>frog bucket hat</h2>
            <p>This is one of the very first frog things I got. I went through a phase where I loved wearing bucket hats and this was my favorite one. My fashion has changed a lot and I don't wear it that much anymore, but it still has a special place in my heart for being one of the first frog things I could show off outside my house.</p>

            <h2>frog heart keychain</h2>
            <p>My partner is also a frog enjoyer so I gifted the other half of this keychain to him as a birthday present. The set contains two frog keychains holding half a magnetic heart so when they're together, they click into place and create a heart! Also, while mine is a little frog guy with wings, his frog has a little bow like cupid (which I think is adorable)!</p>

            <h2>frog purse</h2>
            <p>This here is Ricky the rain frog, a character from the Jellycat brand. One of my more costly purchases, I got this purse in San Francisco a while back before I even knew about the brand. I love Ricky because he can hold my wallet, keys, phone, and more-while looking comically grumpy. I don't know about spirit animals...but I resonate with Ricky. I have a miniature keychain of Ricky as well...but that's for another day.<br>(Also I got the keychain from Ume Tea in Davis!!)</p>

            <h2>gamer frog sticker</h2>
            <p>I got this sticker around Thanksgiving of 2023 and it's now slapped onto my water bottle. I have a lot more of these little stickers, but I like gamer frog because that's pretty much how I look at home. Though while I'm gaming, I think I'm a little less neutral...but I'll reach that level of nonchalance one day maybe. Also as someone who is into mechanical keyboards--having a whimsical, bright yellow keyboard is a nice touch too.</p>
