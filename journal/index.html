                <p>Reading Amir Dori’s <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">"Game Design UX Best Practices"</a> felt like a depressing but accurate representation and idealization of how many mobile games operate on the app store that I’ve been seeing for a long time. While I’m not much of a mobile gamer myself, for the ones I do play like Animal Crossing Pocket Camp – I see them following some of the principles. Not all the design principles are evil or “dark ux,” but some of the things he discussed definitely are a disappointing reality. ACPC isn’t monetized anymore–but was certainly riddled with microtransactions in the past and was highly advertised so.</p> 
            
                <p>Some of the less harmful principles include keeping important navigation and interactive elements in easily accessible screen zones which tend to be on the lower half of screens. For example, in ACPC, the map and menu are all on the bottom, and from there you can access the store and move locations, etc.. It’s definitely convenient and I would be honestly annoyed if it was in some random spot on the top of the screen since I tend to just play on the go and having the main navigation accessible while holding the phone simply is quite nice. </p>

                <p>There are also controls that allow you to skip tutorials which I find very helpful as a veteran player since they essentially cycle through the same 3 events every season. I do think Dori’s take of making it harder to get past tutorials and notifications for more engagement is a little devious, but I’m glad ACPC doesn’t take on that approach other than giving you the option to continue with a refresher tutorial or not. Game design for mobile apps is certainly something that can lead to an addiction, but I feel–if done right, can lead to a very fulfilling and fun experience without manipulating an audience to spend all their time and money on something.

                <p>This image is an oil painting of a bison. The incredible detail that's portrayed in this painting adds so much life and intrigue to the image. The bison's eyes look outside the canvas, shining so lifelike that the audience is also tempted to look in the same direction in wonder of what the bison is seeing. While there is little context to the location as the background is white, there are blobs of white smattered about that indicate somewhere snowy as flakes also rest on top of the bison. While a close up and simplistic background may indicate a simple image, this painting is far from it and evokes a sense of mystery as the close up shot and lifelike gaze brings us in to ask more about what's happening in the scene--while also forcing us to look outside of it as the curious gaze extends beyond.</p>
                <p>I think following a visual narrative of paintings is a great idea to showcase your work and your own personal growth/story. While other paintings in the series might not follow something as strict as "a collection of bison," i think moving along with a sort of theme such as following the journey of people's gazes and delving into more abstract/philisophical themes of joy, loss, curiosity, the mind, etc. would be super interesting. Overall, an amazing piece of art --I can't wait to see how the whole project turns out!</p>

                <p>I'm excited for my theme as frogs are something that I've loved for a long time and have influenced the way I design and draw. This image of a cat plush with a frog hat is special to me because not only was it a gift from my partner, but I also love the brand and collect things from them besides just "frog things". This item is one of many in my frog collection, but it's one of the biggest as most of the others are keychains, pins, and stickers. I think that this image sums me up fairly well as you could infer someone with this likes cute things, likes frogs, likes cats, probably likes bright colors, and so on -- and they'd be correct!

                <p>I love seeing images and interactions in websites. I tend to prefer a minimal style, but seeing graphics and images sprinkled in–especially in a non-static way is so fun to see. By including interactions with the images, they can grab your attention and make you think more deeply at what you’re looking at.</p>
                <p>In Michael Gonchar’s New York Times <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">article</a> he writes about a practice of using images with no context to make an audience think deeper about what the image is about and why it’s meaningful. Making an audience focus on an image can help them think critically about specific details to build a picture and come to a conclusion (if not more) for the story being told in the image.</p>
                <p>Immersive Garden’s <a href="https://davidwhyte.com/experience/">David White Experience</a> makes wonderful use of images and interactions as his watercolor sceneries are animated and users can hover over parts to feel like they’re painting on the scene. By adding scroll effects, you can go further into the story and scene as new pieces pop up too. It’s minimalistic and beautiful with clean animations that are engaging to play with!

            <h2>researching overlay design patterns.</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-1-29">january 29, 2025</time>

                <p>Modal windows or overlays are commonly implemented in UI design and as useful as they can be, they can also just as–if not more frustrating. Naema Baskanderi and the Nielson Norman Group have gone over the difficulties of overlays and how to use them if it is a must for your website.</p>
                <p>Overall, they both urged designers to consider if an overlay is absolutely necessary. If its contents are not urgent or are too long, they suggest using different modes of communication such as using a separate page. Because it forces the user to pause and refocus on the pop-up, whatever information they’re presented with should be short and important to deal with.</p>
                <p>Above all, overlays should be accessible as people’s experiences with them may differ across browsers and devices. Making the overlay keyboard accessible is important as they can use it to enter information into fields and to exit the overlay. Moreover, one of the best practices is to make a “close” button as clear as possible within the overlay so a user doesn’t have to go on a hunt just to close the pop-up. As they can be very useful for progressing user movement and action across a site, overlays should be treated with caution and care when implemented.</p>

            <h2>researching form design.</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-1-19">january 19, 2025</time>
            <div class="post-body-content">
                <p>Going through digital forms is something that has become very common in daily life for me. No matter where I go on the internet, I’m bound to come across some sort of form that asks me to fill in some sort of information. I’ve come across many good forms–or at least ones that I’m willing to go through to get to my end destination. Salim Ansari explained what made these forms efficient and satisfactory in his article <a href="https://www.figma.com/exit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuxdesign.cc%2Fbest-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">Best practices for form design</a>–namely keeping forms clear and concise. Making sure a user knows how far along they are in the process is very motivating for them to continue. Moreover, making it as clear as possible what information is needed with the least amount of clutter while also clearly pointing a user to a mistake helps the process move along more smoothly. </p>
                <p>There have been many times where I’ve been frustrated with an apps onboarding process or other forms as they seemed to drag on and on–wanting as much information from me as they can get. Moreover, there have been times where I’m trying to log in to a certain site or app and don’t have the right information. When this happens, some apps make it excruciatingly annoying and hard to figure out what information is wrong and how exactly I can fix it. Sometimes I’ll just go resetting my password or giving up if I don’t remember the right email and so on.</p>
                <p><a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login?flow_ctx=515a6439-c84f-4c3c-9850-92e67bc1f1cf:1737336453" target="_blank">Spotify</a> has quite a clear login form page that clearly shows the users how they can log in and what information they need. Processes involving an external login are separated from the classic input fields, and the input fields themselves are clear too. With the ability to mask and unmask your password and clear indications on how to reset passwords or sign up for an account instead, the whole process is laid out nicely for all types of users.</p>
