            <h2>researching overlay design patterns.</h2>

                <p>Modal windows or overlays are commonly implemented in UI design and as useful as they can be, they can also just as–if not more frustrating. Naema Baskanderi and the Nielson Norman Group have gone over the difficulties of overlays and how to use them if it is a must for your website.</p>
                <p>Overall, they both urged designers to consider if an overlay is absolutely necessary. If its contents are not urgent or are too long, they suggest using different modes of communication such as using a separate page. Because it forces the user to pause and refocus on the pop-up, whatever information they’re presented with should be short and important to deal with.</p>
                <p>Above all, overlays should be accessible as people’s experiences with them may differ across browsers and devices. Making the overlay keyboard accessible is important as they can use it to enter information into fields and to exit the overlay. Moreover, one of the best practices is to make a “close” button as clear as possible within the overlay so a user doesn’t have to go on a hunt just to close the pop-up. As they can be very useful for progressing user movement and action across a site, overlays should be treated with caution and care when implemented.</p>

            <h2>researching form design.</h2>

                <p>Going through digital forms is something that has become very common in daily life for me. No matter where I go on the internet, I’m bound to come across some sort of form that asks me to fill in some sort of information. I’ve come across many good forms–or at least ones that I’m willing to go through to get to my end destination. Salim Ansari explained what made these forms efficient and satisfactory in his article <a href="https://www.figma.com/exit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuxdesign.cc%2Fbest-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">Best practices for form design</a>–namely keeping forms clear and concise. Making sure a user knows how far along they are in the process is very motivating for them to continue. Moreover, making it as clear as possible what information is needed with the least amount of clutter while also clearly pointing a user to a mistake helps the process move along more smoothly. </p>
                <p>There have been many times where I’ve been frustrated with an apps onboarding process or other forms as they seemed to drag on and on–wanting as much information from me as they can get. Moreover, there have been times where I’m trying to log in to a certain site or app and don’t have the right information. When this happens, some apps make it excruciatingly annoying and hard to figure out what information is wrong and how exactly I can fix it. Sometimes I’ll just go resetting my password or giving up if I don’t remember the right email and so on.</p>
                <p><a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login?flow_ctx=515a6439-c84f-4c3c-9850-92e67bc1f1cf:1737336453" target="_blank">Spotify</a> has quite a clear login form page that clearly shows the users how they can log in and what information they need. Processes involving an external login are separated from the classic input fields, and the input fields themselves are clear too. With the ability to mask and unmask your password and clear indications on how to reset passwords or sign up for an account instead, the whole process is laid out nicely for all types of users.</p>
